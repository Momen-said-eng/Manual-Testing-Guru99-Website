# Manual-Testing-Guru99-Website
This ongoing manual testing project focuses on the Guru99 demo website. I began by testing the Customized Statement module, where I performed requirement analysis, wrote detailed test cases, executed them, and reported the bugs I encountered. The goal is to ensure functionality and UI elements meet expectations. This project is being expanded continuously, as I plan to add more modules step by step, following the same testing process.

Techniques: Requirement analysis · Test case design and execution · Functional testing · UI testing · Bug reporting · Test documentation
Tools: Microsoft Excel
